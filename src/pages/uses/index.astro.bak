          # Development

          - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Yes, I finally gave up on Sublime Text.
          - [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) - REST client of choice.
          - [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) - Better customization options than Terminal.app.

          ## Others

          - [MonoLisa Font](https://monolisa.dev) - I was reluctant to spend money on a font when I got by just fine for years with free ones but this one is totally worth every dollar. [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) was what I had been using before.
          - [VS Code Night Owl Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) - Editor color scheme of choice for years. Good colors and sexy italics.
          - [Insomnia Night Owl Theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/insomnia-plugin-night-owl-theme) - Of course.
          - [iTerm2 Night Owl Theme](https://github.com/nickcernis/iterm2-night-owl) - Duh.
          - [DuckDuckGo](https://ddg.gg) - Default search engine on all browsers.

          # Desktop Apps

          - [Stand](https://getstandapp.com) - A godsend when working for long stretches.
          - [Wipr](https://giorgiocalderolla.com/wipr.html) - No-nonsense content blocker for Safari. I use the [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) browser extension on Firefox and Chromium-based browsers.
          - [Maccy](https://maccy.app) - Free and open-source clipboard manager. Trust me, you need this. Used to use [CopyClip](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/copyclip-clipboard-history/id595191960?mt=12).
          - [Hidden Bar](https://github.com/dwarvesf/hidden) - Lets me hide menu bar icons I don't want to see.
          - [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com) - Because macOS doesn't have window snapping out-of-the-box. Free and open-source; I used to use [Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12) before.
          - [Keka](https://www.keka.io) - Compression/Decompression utility. Used [The Unarchiver](https://macpaw.com/the-unarchiver) before.
          - [DaisyDisk](https://daisydiskapp.com) - Made the sting of using a 128GB SSD less painful.
          - [IINA](https://iina.io) - Built on top of [mpv](https://mpv.io). Perfect balance of power and simplicity.

          # CLIs

          - [`brew`](https://brew.sh) - Vastly easier installation of CLI and GUI apps than graphical setup wizards.
          - [`diceware`](https://github.com/ulif/diceware) - Because a man needs to generate his passphrases.
          - [`tldr`](https://tldr.sh) - Simplified `man` pages.
          - [`speedtest`](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli) - Speedtest.net straight from the Terminal.
          - [`n`](https://github.com/tj/n) - A better `nvm`, IMO.

          # Phone Apps

          - [Pocket Casts](https://pocketcasts.com) - I've been using Pocket Casts on Android way before I got my first iPhone in 2019; I'll give it another shot in 2022. I've been a Premium [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) subscriber for the last three years on iOS.
          - [Nudget](https://nudgetapp.com) - Super simple budgeting app.
          - [Tailor](https://apps.apple.com/ph/app/tailor-screenshot-stitching/id926653095) - Screenshots stitching.
          - [Apollo](https://apolloapp.io) - Best reddit client on iOS.
          - [Barista](https://www.baristacoffeeapp.com) - I only have a generic kitchen scale so I got this app to compensate for the lack of a timer.

          I just use a lot of first-party iOS apps for the rest: Mail, Reminders, Notes, Weather, etc.

          # Services and Subscriptions

          - [1Password](https://1password.com) - The best damn password manager on the planet.
          - [Apple Music (Family)](https://www.apple.com/ph/apple-music/) - Music streaming service of choice. I really like how it lets me upload and sync music from elsewhere.
          - [Netflix](https://netflix.com) - You already know what this is.

          # Gear

          - Apple Mac Mini (M1, 2020) - Code compilation beast; eats through large projects without breaking a sweat. It's the best damn computer I have ever owned.
          - [Apple iPhone XR](/blog/iphone-xr-review) - Excellent budget iPhone that I see myself using for three more years

          ### Audio

          - [Sony WH-1000XM3](https://www.sony.com.ph/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm3) - These'll take you to sonic wonderland and silence paradise.
          - [Apple AirPods with Charging Case (2nd Generation)](https://www.apple.com/ph/airpods-2nd-generation/) - Pricey magical earbuds with crappy sound.
          - [Sennheiser CX 80S](https://ph.sennheiser.com/products/cx-80s) - These sound better than my AirPods and they're like 20% the price.

          ### Peripherals
          - [Mi 23.8" Desktop Monitor 1C](https://www.mi.com/global/mi-23.8-desktop-monitor-1c/) - 1080p external display.
          - [Liebert Vertiv PSA650-SOHO](https://www.vertiv.com/en-asia/products-catalog/critical-power/uninterruptible-power-supplies-ups/psa650-soho/) - 390-watt UPS for the Mac Mini. Overkill for the power-sipping computer and monitor plugged into it.
          - [Royal Kludge RK84 Mechanical Keybord](https://gameone.ph/rk-royal-kludge-rk84-tri-mode-rgb-84-keys-hot-swappable-mechanical-keyboard-black-brown.html) - My first mechincal keyboard. It has Bluetooth but I just use it in wired mode with the Mac Mini. Typing feels super great on its brown switches.
          - [Logitech MX Anywhere 2S Bluetooth Mouse](https://shopee.ph/Logitech-MX-Anywhere-2S-Wireless-Mobile-Mouse-(Graphite)-(ONLINE-EXCLUSIVE)-i.55502962.1568650454) - Last-gen flagship travel mouse from Logitech.
          - [8BitDo SN30 Pro+](https://www.8bitdo.com/sn30-pro-plus/) - For playing Hollow Knight, Stardew Valley, and Fantasian.
