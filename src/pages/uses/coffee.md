- [Omega Copen Stainless Steel French Press (350ml)](https://omegahouseware.com.ph/products/copen-stainless-steel-french-press-with-filter-350ml-600ml) - A replacement for the 800ml Hosh French Press I had clumsily broken.
- [Hario V60 Drip Decanter](https://www.hario.com.ph/product-page/hario-v60-drip-decanter-pour-over-coffee-set) - My first foray into drip brewing. [Tetsu Kasuya's 4:6 method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCW8xSWGZY) is what I loosely follow; [James Hoffmann's Ultimate V60 Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI4ynXzkSQo) for larger brews. I use this more than the French Press nowadays. Procured on January 2022.
- [Hario Mini Mill Slim+](https://www.hario.com.ph/product-page/hario-ceramic-coffee-grinder-mini-slim-plus) - An arm workout in exchange for fresh coffee. Consistency is good enough.
- [TIMEMORE Thin Spout Fish Electric Pour Over Kettle](https://www.lazada.com.ph/products/timemore-thin-spout-fish-electric-pour-over-kettle-black-600ml-i1314224070-s4796114099.html) - The cheapest electric gooseneck kettle I could buy.
- A kitchen scale I don't know the brand of. It has TARE and is supposedly accurate to 0.1 of a gram. It doesn't have timer functionality. I use the [Barista](https://www.baristacoffeeapp.com) for iOS to time my brews.
