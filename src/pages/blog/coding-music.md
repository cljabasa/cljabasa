I solve problems through software for a living. No easy feat. While I do demand silence when I need to get into the nitty-gritty, more often than not, I turn to music to get the creative juices flowing.

Let's talk about criteria. Given that I can't stand the mere sound of people talking, I prefer instrumental, ambient music while working. Vocals are fine but they have to not be in english; choirs get the job done too. Lastly, I'm not a fan of playlists so I pick hour-long albums instead.

With these out of the way, here are a few albums I queue up when I'm coding.

## On Final Fantasy
I grew up playing Final Fantasy on the Game Boy and I got really hooked. _Final Fantasy VI_, in particular, is a game which I have sunk more than 220-hours of playtime on. I consider it to be the best game I have ever played. Yes, I got deeply emotionally invested in the characters and the wild roller-coaster ride of a story they were all part of.

Thus, I will forever revere [Nobuo Uematsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobuo_Uematsu) for the musical genius that he is for composing the soundtracks to much of Final Fantasy franchise's installments. His music is the imagination and creativity unbound; writing masterpeices despite [limited technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiptune). Uematsu essentially made [The Creation of Adam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Creation_of_Adam) with crayons. 

_Fantasian_, which I now play, is also made by Final Fantasy creator [Hironobu Sakaguchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hironobu_Sakaguchi) and has a soundtrack exclusively by Uematsu. The game instantly took me those sweet times. 

Having these soundtracks on queue while working makes me feel like a hero on a quest to save the world from the clutches of evil. Fun fact: I was listening to the Final Fantasy V Original Soundtrack as I wrote this.

## On Doom
Confession: I haven't really played Doom. I've never been a fan of first-person shooter games. Oh, and I didn't really have capable computers or the money for triple-A gaming during these years. But what did happen during these years is I developed a taste for heavy music. The Doom Original Game Soundtrack is just that: heavy. It works for me despite its filthy guitar riffs and violent percussion. It also helps that I feel like the Doomslayer slaughtering demons.

## On Our Planet
I really loved Our Planet. _Cosmos: A SpaceTime Odyssey_ is still my favorite docuseries, but this is a close second. Our Planet has marvelous cinematography and narration, but what most people won't notice is its original score. Steven Price was able to write a soundtrack that complements what's on the screen impeccably. You really don't notice great background music. When I listen to this album while working I tend to be surprised that I had been listening for hours when I though I had just started a few minutes ago.

## On Two Steps From Hell and Thomas Bergersen
In case it wasn't obvious enough, I like epic music. Two Steps From Hell has an extensive catalog of these but this time I went for the albums that are less stimulating. So gentle, orchestral music that soothe my mind and soul.
