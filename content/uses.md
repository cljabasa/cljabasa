# Development

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Yes, I finally gave up on Sublime Text.
- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) - REST client of choice.
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) - Better customization options than Terminal.app.

## Others

- [MonoLisa Font](https://monolisa.dev) - I was reluctant to spend money on a font when I got by just fine for years with free ones but this one is totally worth every dollar. [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) was what I had been using before.
- [VS Code Night Owl Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) - Editor color scheme of choice for years. Good colors and sexy italics.

# Desktop Apps

- [Maccy](https://maccy.app) - Free and open-source clipboard manager. Trust me, you need this. Used to use [CopyClip](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/copyclip-clipboard-history/id595191960?mt=12).
- [Hidden Bar](https://github.com/dwarvesf/hidden) - Lets me hide menu bar icons I don't want to see.
- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com) - Because macOS doesn't have window snapping out-of-the-box. Free and open-source; I used to use [Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12) before.
- [Keka](https://www.keka.io) - Compression/Decompression utility. Used [The Unarchiver](https://macpaw.com/the-unarchiver) before.
- [DaisyDisk](https://daisydiskapp.com) - Made the sting of using a 128GB SSD less painful.
- [IINA](https://iina.io) - Built on top of [mpv](https://mpv.io). Perfect balance of power and simplicity.

# CLIs

- [`speedtest`](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli) - Speedtest.net straight from the Terminal.
- [`n`](https://github.com/tj/n) - A better `nvm`, IMO.

# Phone Apps

- [Pocket Casts](https://pocketcasts.com) - I've been using Pocket Casts on Android way before I got my first iPhone in 2019; I'll give it another shot in 2022. I've been a Premium [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) subscriber for the last three years on iOS.
- [Nudget](https://nudgetapp.com) - Super simple budgeting app.
- [Tailor](https://apps.apple.com/ph/app/tailor-screenshot-stitching/id926653095) - Screenshots stitching.
- [Apollo](https://apolloapp.io) - Best reddit client on iOS.
- [Barista](https://www.baristacoffeeapp.com) - I only have a generic kitchen scale so I got this app to compensate for the lack of a timer.

I just use a lot of first-party iOS apps for the rest: Mail, Reminders, Notes, Weather, etc.

# Services and Subscriptions

- [1Password](https://1password.com) - The best damn password manager on the planet.
- [Apple Music (Family)](https://www.apple.com/ph/apple-music/) - Music streaming service of choice. I really like how it lets me upload and sync music from elsewhere.
- [Netflix](https://netflix.com) - You already know what this is.

# Gear

- Apple Mac Mini (M1, 2020) - Code compilation beast; eats through large projects without breaking a sweat. It's the best damn computer I have ever owned.
- [Apple iPhone XR](/blog/iphone-xr-review) - Excellent budget iPhone that I see myself using for three more years

### Audio

- [Sony WH-1000XM3](https://www.sony.com.ph/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm3) - These'll take you to sonic wonderland and silence paradise.
- [Apple AirPods with Charging Case (2nd Generation)](https://www.apple.com/ph/airpods-2nd-generation/) - Pricey magical earbuds with crappy sound.
- [Sennheiser CX 80S](https://ph.sennheiser.com/products/cx-80s) - These sound better than my AirPods and they're like 20% the price.

### Peripherals
- [Mi 23.8" Desktop Monitor 1C](https://www.mi.com/global/mi-23.8-desktop-monitor-1c/) - 1080p external display.

- [Royal Kludge RK84 Mechanical Keybord](https://gameone.ph/rk-royal-kludge-rk84-tri-mode-rgb-84-keys-hot-swappable-mechanical-keyboard-black-brown.html) - My first mechincal keyboard. It has Bluetooth but I just use it in wired mode with the Mac Mini. Typing feels super great on its brown switches.

# Coffee

I try to keep my setup lean in case the world stops ending and I end up being away from home again. I fell into the coffee rabbit hole seven months into the pandemic.

## Gear

- [Omega Copen Stainless Steel French Press (350ml)](https://omegahouseware.com.ph/products/copen-stainless-steel-french-press-with-filter-350ml-600ml) - A replacement for the 800ml Hosh French Press I had clumsily broken.
- [Hario V60 Drip Decanter](https://www.hario.com.ph/product-page/hario-v60-drip-decanter-pour-over-coffee-set) - My first foray into drip brewing. [Tetsu Kasuya's 4:6 method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCW8xSWGZY) is what I loosely follow; [James Hoffmann's Ultimate V60 Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI4ynXzkSQo) for larger brews. I use this more than the French Press nowadays. Procured on January 2022.
- [Hario Mini Mill Slim+](https://www.hario.com.ph/product-page/hario-ceramic-coffee-grinder-mini-slim-plus) - An arm workout in exchange for fresh coffee. Consistency is good enough.
- [TIMEMORE Thin Spout Fish Electric Pour Over Kettle](https://www.lazada.com.ph/products/timemore-thin-spout-fish-electric-pour-over-kettle-black-600ml-i1314224070-s4796114099.html) - The cheapest electric gooseneck kettle I could buy.
- A kitchen scale I don't know the brand of. It has TARE and is supposedly accurate to 0.1 of a gram. It doesn't have timer functionality. I use the [Barista](https://www.baristacoffeeapp.com) for iOS to time my brews.

## Beans

Purchased 250-grams of Sagada coffee beans for Php. 150.00 from [Keidra's Cafe](https://goo.gl/maps/uQ99ddwj9BPM8YeS9). I have no idea when the coffee beans were roasted but they don't taste stale. In fact, the coffee looks scrumptiously red in the deacanter. It has hints of sweetness.

![Sagada Coffee Beans - Keidra's Cafe](https://res.cloudinary.com/kadto/image/upload/v1644500589/cljabasa/uses/d9068e1185cd1b61d6b9c0b6e3b88fbe.jpg)

My tongue only notices sweetness and roast levels for now. I'm still learning to taste so I can only say if I like it or not. I can't yet tell if coffee is earthy, or citrusy, or if it has chocolate notes.

### Previous (Newest First)

_I might give these another shot because I have a grinder now._

- [RGCoffee Arabica](https://www.instagram.com/rgcoffee.ph) - Pre-ground. Bought it because they said it's grown in our backyard over at Kanlaon. I'd say it has medium-acidity. I like this better than the House Blend listed below.
- [Silafe House Blend](https://www.silcacoffee.com/portfolio-items/silcafe-house-blend/?portfolioCats=56) - Pre-ground. Tastes _meh_. Into cold brew it goes.
- [Silafe French Roast](https://shopee.ph/Silcafe-French-Roast-500g-i.235610698.4681449967) - Pre-ground. Too dark for my liking; darker than the Italian Roast. Made cold brew coffee instead and sweetened the hell out of it.
- [Silafe Italian Roast](https://shopee.ph/Silcafe-Italian-Roast-500g-i.235610698.8223994979) - Pre-ground. Too dark for my liking so I made cold brew coffee instead and sweetened the hell out of it.
