- [Omega Copen Stainless Steel French Press (350ml)](https://omegahouseware.com.ph/products/copen-stainless-steel-french-press-with-filter-350ml-600ml) - A replacement for the 800ml Hosh French Press I had clumsily broken.
- [Hario V60 Drip Decanter](https://www.hario.com.ph/product-page/hario-v60-drip-decanter-pour-over-coffee-set) - My first foray into drip brewing. [Tetsu Kasuya's 4:6 method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCW8xSWGZY) is what I loosely follow; [James Hoffmann's Ultimate V60 Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI4ynXzkSQo) for larger brews. I use this more than the French Press nowadays. Procured on January 2022.
- [Hario Mini Mill Slim+](https://www.hario.com.ph/product-page/hario-ceramic-coffee-grinder-mini-slim-plus) - An arm workout in exchange for fresh coffee. Consistency is good enough.
- [TIMEMORE Thin Spout Fish Electric Pour Over Kettle](https://www.lazada.com.ph/products/timemore-thin-spout-fish-electric-pour-over-kettle-black-600ml-i1314224070-s4796114099.html) - The cheapest electric gooseneck kettle I could buy.
- A kitchen scale I don't know the brand of. It has TARE and is supposedly accurate to 0.1 of a gram. It doesn't have timer functionality. I use the [Barista](https://www.baristacoffeeapp.com) for iOS to time my brews.

## Beans

My tongue only notices sweetness and roast levels for now. I'm still learning to taste so I can only say if I like it or not. I can't yet tell if coffee is earthy, or citrusy, or if it has chocolate notes.

### March 17, 2022
Purchased 200-grams of [The Dream Coffee coffee beans](https://thedreamcoffee.ph/products/wholebeans) for Php. 395.00 from, well, [The Dream Coffee](https://thedreamcoffee.ph/). I placed an order on the 10th of March and got it on the 17th. I'm glad to report that the coffee beans have a roast date: 8th of March 2022. Not bad. Bought because of the pretty packaging and I was sold on [the story](https://thedreamcoffee.ph/blogs/learn/learn-the-dream). Feedback soon.

Update 2022/03/21: It has sweet, funky-fermented-fruit flavors.

### March 12, 2022

Purchased 250-grams of [Cadiz Blend](https://www.instagram.com/p/CZ5xzdJPELF/) coffee grounds for a price I don't remember from [Little Farmers Coffee](https://www.facebook.com/Littlefarmerscoffee). I had it ground at the store. Feedback soon.

### February 24, 2022

Purchased 250-grams of Kanlaon coffee beans for Php. 155.00 from [Little Farmers Coffee](https://www.facebook.com/Littlefarmerscoffee). Like my last purchase, I have no idea when these coffee beans were roasted. It's a darker roast compared the Sagada coffee beans. Feedback soon.

### February 10, 2022

Purchased 250-grams of Sagada coffee beans for Php. 150.00 from [Keidra's Cafe](https://goo.gl/maps/uQ99ddwj9BPM8YeS9). I have no idea when the coffee beans were roasted but they don't taste stale. In fact, the coffee looks scrumptiously red in the deacanter. It has hints of sweetness.

_I might give these another shot because I have a grinder now._

- [RGCoffee Arabica](https://www.instagram.com/rgcoffee.ph) - Pre-ground. Bought it because they said it's grown in our backyard over at Kanlaon. I'd say it has medium-acidity. I like this better than the House Blend listed below.
- [Silafe House Blend](https://www.silcacoffee.com/portfolio-items/silcafe-house-blend/?portfolioCats=56) - Pre-ground. Tastes _meh_. Into cold brew it goes.
- [Silafe French Roast](https://shopee.ph/Silcafe-French-Roast-500g-i.235610698.4681449967) - Pre-ground. Too dark for my liking; darker than the Italian Roast. Made cold brew coffee instead and sweetened the hell out of it.
- [Silafe Italian Roast](https://shopee.ph/Silcafe-Italian-Roast-500g-i.235610698.8223994979) - Pre-ground. Too dark for my liking so I made cold brew coffee instead and sweetened the hell out of it.
- [Bo's Coffee's Atok, Benguet](https://www.boscoffee.com/products/atok-benguet) - Pre-ground. I don't remember how it tasted.
- [Bo's Barista Blend, Benguet](https://www.boscoffee.com/products/barista-blend) - Pre-ground. I don't remember how it tasted.
- [Bo's Coffee's Sagada](https://www.boscoffee.com/products/atok-benguet) - Pre-ground. I don't remember how it tasted.
